This is MySQL and Postgre data layers for YetAnotherForum. It should be completely upgradable from YAF previous versions. Report bugs if there will be problems.
Simply replace corresponding files. Details are in manual. It's a bit outdated but I'll sync it when I have time.
Current version is for 1.9.6 RC1
